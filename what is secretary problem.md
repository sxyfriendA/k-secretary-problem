# Secretary Problem
## simplest form of the secretary problem
1. There is one secretary position available (存在一个可供选择的秘书位置)
2. The  number n of applicants is known. (参加面试的人人数已知)
3. The applicants are interviewed sequentially in random order, each order being equally likely. (申请人按随机顺序接受访谈，每种顺序都具有相同的可能性。)
4.  It is assumed that you can rank all the applicants from best to worst without ties. The decision to accept or reject an applicant must be based only on the relative ranks of those applicants inter- viewed so far. 
    (假设您可以将所有申请人从最佳状态排列到最差状态(不存在相同状态)。 接受或拒绝申请人的决定必须仅基于迄今为止所访问的申请人的相对等级。)
5.   An applicant once rejected cannot later be re- called. (一个受试者当被拒绝时不能再之后再次被召回)
6. You are very particular and will be satisfied with nothing but the very best. (That is, your payoff is 1 if you choose the best of the n applicants and O otherwise
   （只有选到最佳的人时数学期望为1，其余情况数学期望均为0）
